	description `Flak Turret won't be able to deal much damage against anything bigger than fighter, but the explosion from this weapon will also damage nearby ships around the target, including your ships.`
	description ` There has been story passed around about two groups of pirates working together to attack a convoy of mule guarded with a lot of fighter. One of the groups relied heavily on this weapon hoping to bombard the enemy fighter while staying away from the range of their blaster and laser, however they accidentally destroyed one of their ally. In the end the two pirate groups fight against themselves while the merchant watched nonchalantly.`

	description `Artillery Battery is considered to be one of the oldest weapon that can be used for a spaceship today, it was first used by humanity for more than a millennium ago before spacefaring was reality. It was even more deadlier now with the advancement of technology, although nothing much changes with the general design, it was fitted with fast-firing automated reloading and even more explosive round. However they are slow, less accurate and can be intercepted with anti-missile system.`
	description `	Unlike other turret, Artillery Battery requires an additional crew for the turret to operate efficiently.`

	description `Heavy Artillery Battery is a bigger version of Artillery Battery. While Artillery Battery were made for smaller craft, Heavy Artillery Battery were made to combat from medium to large warships.`
